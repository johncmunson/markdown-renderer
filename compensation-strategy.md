## 1. Compensation Philosophy

The compensation strategy for our engineering team aims to align employee motivation with the company's goals while maintaining fairness, transparency, and scalability. Specifically, our approach is defined by:

- **Market Positioning**: We aim to offer compensation around the 50th percentile of the market for roles across our team. Our goal is to remain competitive within the industry, ensuring fair pay for all roles while maintaining fiscal responsibility and supporting sustainable growth.
- **Cash Compensation and Bonuses**: Our compensation package consists of a competitive base salary and performance-based bonuses. This approach emphasizes rewarding both consistent contributions and high-impact achievements.
- **Pay for Impact**: Compensation is tied directly to individual and team performance. We reward meaningful contributions over tenure, prioritizing those who help achieve key team goals and create lasting value.

## 2. Market Benchmarking and Internal Equity

We will conduct **market benchmarking** once a year to ensure our compensation remains competitive. This will include using industry surveys and compensation data to keep pay ranges up to date. Third-party consultants may be leveraged as necessary.

**Pay bands** have been established for each role within the team. These bands ensure **internal equity** across the team, with compensation within each band determined by performance, experience, and market rate adjustments. Pay bands will be reviewed annually and adjusted as needed, especially when market benchmarks change significantly.

In addition, we have created clear levels for both **Individual Contributor** and **Management** tracks. This structure allows employees to grow in their careers without being forced into management if they prefer a technical path. Promotions and corresponding compensation adjustments will be based on demonstrated skills, measurable impact, and defined competencies for each level.

See Section 9 for a breakdown of career tracks.

## 3. Preventing Title Drift and Title Bloat

To address title drift, where titles misalign with responsibilities, and title bloat, where numerous one-off roles lack alignment with career tracks, we maintain a **structured approach** to role definition and progression. Each role has clear expectations, competencies, and impact, with regular reviews to keep titles aligned with actual responsibilities. Promotions are based on transparent criteria tied to skills and performance, ensuring titles are meaningful and relevant.

Compensation growth is not strictly tied to title changes, allowing pay increases based on performance and market adjustments **without requiring a title change**. This helps prevent "title inflation" as a means of recognition and ensures titles stay aligned with role responsibilities rather than being driven by pay adjustments.

By preserving a standardized career structure, we simplify the organizational overview for upper management, making it easier to understand the tech department’s structure and talent distribution. A consistent title framework also enhances collaboration with other departments, providing a clear view of roles and responsibilities, which helps streamline cross-functional interactions and interface more effectively. Overall, this approach **maintains title integrity** and supports both internal clarity and external collaboration.

## 4. Incentives for Collaboration

To foster **collaboration**, team performance will play a significant role in compensation decisions. Individual contributions will be evaluated not only based on personal achievements but also on how effectively they support team objectives. Performance evaluations will take into account factors such as mentorship, teamwork, knowledge sharing, and cross-functional contributions.

**Peer feedback and 360-degree reviews** will be incorporated to assess collaborative behaviors and recognize individuals who contribute significantly to team success. This is to ensure that we maintain a holistic view of an employee's performance, skills, and behaviors from multiple perspectives when evaluating performance.

## 5. Commentary on Quantitative Performance Metrics

As we move toward a more structured career and compensation plan, there's a natural inclination to implement quantitative performance metrics. While often well-intentioned, it's important to heed the following insights:

> "What gets measured gets managed — even when it’s pointless to measure and manage it, and even if it harms the purpose of the organization."  
> -**Peter Drucker**

> "Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight."  
> -**Bill Gates**

> "The manager who insists on seeing measurable progress every week soon finds that the team devotes most of its time to making measurable progress at the expense of progress in other ways."  
> -**Tom DeMarco**

> "When we over-measure, we tell people we don’t trust them."  
> -**Patrick Lencioni**

Measuring productivity, especially in software-oriented teams not directly exposed to clients, is deceptively complex. Poorly designed metrics can harm morale, be counterproductive, and burden middle management. Though the intent is to improve decision-making, such metrics are often easily gamed, invalidating their usefulness.

We advocate for a balanced approach that emphasizes qualitative evaluations, such as 360-degree feedback, which provides a comprehensive view of individual contributions beyond metrics. Performance should be assessed based on team outcomes and their impact on organizational goals, not narrowly defined quantitative measures.

Empowered middle management is key to this approach, bridging leadership and individual contributors through mentorship, feedback, and talent development based on real contributions and team dynamics. This builds a culture of trust and meaningful growth.

While we are not entirely ruling out quantitative metrics, they should be adopted with caution and clear intent, supporting — not replacing — human judgment and context. Metrics should inform, not dictate, fostering a culture of trust, contribution, and sustainable growth.

## 6. Commitment to Internal Hiring

We are committed to developing and promoting talent from within the organization before seeking external candidates for open roles. Our internal hiring strategy aligns with our broader goals of fostering a strong team culture, encouraging career development, and ensuring that our employees are recognized and rewarded for their contributions. Whenever a new role or opportunity arises, our first step will be to evaluate existing team members for potential fit.

This approach offers several key benefits:

- **Career Growth and Development**: By looking internally first, we provide our employees with clear career pathways and opportunities for advancement. This helps in motivating team members to enhance their skills and align their career goals with the company's growth.
- **Talent Retention**: Demonstrating a preference for internal hiring reinforces our commitment to valuing and investing in our people. Team members who see opportunities for advancement are more likely to remain engaged and committed to the company.
- **Culture Continuity**: Existing employees already understand our values, culture, and business processes, which allows for a smoother transition when filling a role internally. This continuity supports team cohesion and strengthens our collaborative environment.
- **Faster Onboarding and Ramp-Up**: Internal hires generally require less time to onboard compared to external hires, as they are already familiar with our products, technologies, and internal processes.

To facilitate this approach, we will ensure that open roles are communicated transparently across the team, providing all eligible employees the opportunity to express interest. In addition, we will support team members in developing the skills and competencies needed for future career growth through training, mentorship, and continuous feedback.

## 7. Compensation Transparency

We are committed to maintaining transparency around our compensation policies, processes, and decisions. Transparency helps build trust within our team, fosters open communication, and supports a culture of fairness and equity. Our aim is to ensure that every team member understands how compensation is determined, what factors influence their pay, and how they can grow within their role.

Transparency is upheld through the following mechanisms:

- **Clear Pay Bands and Career Tracks**: We provide transparent pay bands for each role and level, so team members can clearly see the potential compensation ranges and understand how progression within their career track affects their pay.
- **Open Communication Around Changes**: Any adjustments to pay bands, bonus structures, or compensation policies will be communicated openly and in a timely manner, ensuring that all employees have access to the information they need.
- **Access to Benchmarking and Rationale**: To ensure fair and market-aligned compensation, we conduct annual benchmarking and adjust pay bands as needed. Team members will have insight into how market data influences compensation adjustments and how our compensation philosophy aligns with company goals.

We encourage open conversations about compensation and career growth during performance reviews, 1:1 meetings, and dedicated feedback sessions. Managers are prepared to provide context and clarity on how compensation decisions are made and to help team members understand their path for career advancement and earning potential.

By upholding a commitment to transparency, we aim to empower our team with the information and opportunities they need to achieve their professional and financial goals, while ensuring alignment with the company’s broader objectives.

### Modifying Career Tracks or Creating New Ones

In the future we may have the need for additional roles or career tracks. Or, we may need to modify existing ones. Use the following table, taken from the book _Scaling People_ by Claire Hughes Johnson, as a guideline.

## 10. Performance-Based Bonus Program

To motivate and reward all team members for their contributions to both individual and company success, we will implement a performance-based bonus program. Bonuses will be distributed annually, based on a mix of company, team, and individual performance metrics to ensure alignment with organizational goals and role-specific contributions. Target bonuses vary by role and level, with higher-level and higher-impact roles eligible for larger target bonuses.

### Performance Metrics and Payout

The bonus structure uses a balanced scorecard approach, which includes:

- **Company Performance (40%)**: A significant portion of bonuses will be tied to achieving overall company goals such as revenue targets, successful product launches, and strategic milestones.
- **Team Performance (30%)**: A portion will reflect team-based achievements, such as hitting key deliverables, ensuring project quality, and effective cross-functional collaboration.
- **Individual Performance (30%)**: The remaining portion is tied to individual performance and impact, evaluated against personal goals, contributions to team success, and role-specific competencies.

---pagebreak---

### Bonus Calculation Formula

The potential bonus for an employee is calculated as follows:

```
Potential Bonus = Base Salary x Target Bonus Percentage x
  ( Company Performance Weight x Company Performance Score
  + Team Performance Weight x Team Performance Score
  + Individual Performance Weight x Individual Performance Score )
```

#### Example Calculation

For an employee with:

- A **base salary** of **$100,000**
- A **target bonus percentage** of **7%**
- **Weights** of **40%** (Company), **30%** (Team), and **30%** (Individual)
- **Performance scores** of **75%** (Company), **90%** (Team), and **80%** (Individual)

The potential bonus would be calculated as:

```
Bonus = $100,000 x 0.07 x
  ( 0.4 x 0.75
  + 0.3 x 0.9
  + 0.3 x 0.8 )

Bonus = $5,670
```

## -- NOTES & TODOS --

- Can this document be expanded to apply to the entire tech department?
- Create templates for performance reviews and 360-degree reviews
- If we ever get a departmental budget, expand upon how our compensation strategy relates to the budget. To be honest, it's borderline unacceptable that departmental budgets aren't in place. I don't see how departments can be empowered to make autonomous decisions if we aren't given a budget. Any manager worth his/her salt would demand a budget.
- With respect to bonuses, do we need to explicitly address the following items? If there's one thing I know to be true about upper management, it's that they love to move the field goal posts.
  - Who decides which goals matter?
  - Who decides whether or not the goal was acheived, or to what extent a project was successful?
  - Who decides what the Company Performance Score is?
  - Who decides what the Team Performance Score is?
  - If the salary target is 7-10%, who decides what value is going to be used? Should we have static bonus targets (i.e. 5%) instead of a target range?
- Do we need to hire a consultant to verify our salary bands and bonus targets are aligned with the overall market? Or can HR be trusted with this responsibility? Nothing against Hunter, but there's likely to be distrust in the process if this is left solely to our own HR department.
- _"We aim to offer compensation around the 50th percentile of the market..."_
  - Are we trying to attract top talent?
  - Or are we trying to attract average talent?
  - Josh seems to aim for average or below average market rates. If that's the strategy, then we need to be transparent about it and mention how this is aligned with our long-term goals.
- What happens if market benchmarking indicates that salaries for a particular role have _decreased_ from one year to the next? Do we need commentary on how this situation will be handled if it occurs?
- It's pretty obvious why the company _should_ implement a fair bonus program for the tech department. But, here are the reasons why I believe we can _afford_ a bonus program, in case there's resistance.
  - WSW is gone. That was a massive company expense. Leadership has indicated those funds will be reallocated towards investing in our employees.
  - Mike and Scott are gone. I don't know what they were being paid, but I don't think they were cheap.
  - The average developer salary is _way down_ from it's peak several years ago.
- The sales team has a bonus/commision program. The ops department has a bonus program. For these reasons, the tech department doesn't so much _request_ a fair and sensible bonus program as we _demand_ one. Historically, the tech department and engineering team have received very meager 1-2% bonuses that are purely at the discretion of top-level leadership who has very little insight into actual team and individual contributor performance. In addition, differing bonuses between team members have been determined solely on tenure, without accounting for merit. The engineering team rejects the status quo. The status quo is abhorrent and insulting.
- Should the bonus program be purely cash based? Or should it be more holistic and include things like additional vacation days?
- Should this document address opportunities and stipends for continuing education?
- Do we need to account for cost-of-living in different markets?
- Do we need to address working-from-home?
