## Proposal: Structured Career Tracks and a Formal Compensation Strategy

<br><br>

### Big Idea #1: Pay for Performance

Organizations are sustained by the collective output of people. When employee output is higher and of greater quality, the organization benefits. The best and most efficient way to align organizational needs with employee output is to _pay for performance_. In other words, incentive employees to work hard. Incentivize employees to do good work.

The sales department has a commission structure. The ops department has a bonus program. _The tech department has no equivalent mechanism aligning performance with pay_.

### Big Idea #2: Structured Career Tracks

Should this guy get a raise? Or maybe he needs a promotion? Has he earned it? _How could you possibly know without a structured career track already in place_ that provides guidance, direction and, crucially, already has buy-in? Any time the topic of raises or promotions comes up, a manager or director has to make a judgement call on whether or not it's warranted and then has to decide if it's a battle worth fighting with HR and leadership.

Every time, it's like starting from square one with these discussions. Managers hate it. I'm sure Hunter hates it. It's a bullshit process that is easily mitigated with a structured plan.

### Big Idea #3: Be Transparent

Is our strategy to hire at the 50th percentile of the market, or even below that? Fine, whatever. Not a winning strategy in my opinion, but if that's the strategy then _fucking own it and be transparent about it_.

How do we even know where we're at in comparison with the market? Either we don't know or leadership isn't being transparent. Do the research, share the results, be trustworthy.
