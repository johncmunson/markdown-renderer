## 1. Overview

### Compensation Philosophy

Our compensation approach ensures competitive, fair, and sustainable pay aligned with company goals. Compensation includes a base salary around the 50th percentile of market benchmarks, complemented by performance-based bonuses that reward meaningful contributions over tenure. We prioritize paying for impact, with a focus on individual and team performance.

### Market Benchmarking & Internal Equity

We conduct annual market benchmarking to maintain competitiveness, utilizing industry surveys and third-party consultants as needed. Internal pay equity is achieved through clear pay bands for each role, reviewed yearly. Both Individual Contributor and Management career tracks are available, allowing for technical or managerial growth paths.

### Preventing Title Drift & Bloat

To maintain role clarity, titles are reviewed regularly to ensure alignment with responsibilities. We prevent title inflation by offering compensation growth tied to performance rather than titles. This promotes clear understanding of roles across the organization, enhancing cross-department collaboration and maintaining structure consistency.

### Collaboration Incentives

Collaboration is a key factor in compensation, with team performance playing a significant role in evaluations. We incorporate peer feedback and 360-degree reviews to assess collaborative contributions, ensuring compensation reflects both individual achievements and team dynamics.

### Performance Metrics Approach

While quantitative metrics can help measure success, we emphasize qualitative evaluations and team outcomes over rigid metrics. Empowered middle management bridges leadership and individual contributors through mentorship and feedback, ensuring performance evaluations account for real contributions rather than arbitrary targets.

### Commitment to Internal Hiring

We prioritize internal talent development and hiring, which provides career growth opportunities, improves retention, and supports culture continuity. Internal hires are familiar with our systems, which reduces onboarding time and strengthens team cohesion.

### Compensation Transparency

We maintain transparency by providing clear pay bands and open communication around compensation changes. Regular performance reviews and open conversations empower team members to understand how their pay is determined and how they can progress in their careers.

### Modifying Career Tracks or Creating New Ones

In the future we may have the need for additional roles or career tracks. Or, we may need to modify existing ones. Refer to Table 4 in the book _Scaling People_ by Claire Hughes Johnson for inspiration and guidelines. _Note: Not all career tracks for the tech department have been fleshed out yet, as this document is still in a draft state._

## 4. Performance-Based Bonus Program

The purpose of the bonus program is to reward employees for individual and company success. Bonuses will be awarded annually, based on company, team, and individual performance metrics, ensuring alignment with organizational goals. Higher-level and higher-impact roles are eligible for larger target bonuses.

### Performance Metrics and Payout

The bonus structure follows a balanced scorecard approach:

- **Company Performance (40%)**: Tied to overall company goals like revenue targets, product launches, and strategic milestones.
- **Team Performance (30%)**: Reflects team achievements, such as hitting key deliverables and cross-functional collaboration.
- **Individual Performance (30%)**: Tied to individual goals, contributions, and competencies.

### Bonus Calculation Formula

The potential bonus for an employee is calculated as follows:

```
Potential Bonus = Base Salary x Target Bonus Percentage x
  ( Company Performance Weight x Company Performance Score
  + Team Performance Weight x Team Performance Score
  + Individual Performance Weight x Individual Performance Score )
```

#### Example Calculation

For an employee with a $100,000 salary, 7% target bonus, and scores of 75% (Company), 90% (Team), and 80% (Individual):

```
Bonus = $100,000 x 0.07 x ((0.4 x 0.75) + (0.3 x 0.9) + (0.3 x 0.8))
      = $5,670
```
