# P-Zero

(John's Slightly Modified Version)

**P-Zero is a modular training framework developed by Cody Lefever**, creator of GZCLP, General Gainz, Jacked & Tan 2.0, and other widely respected programs. It represents the most refined version of his tier-based approach, integrating over a decade of training and coaching experience into a highly adaptable system.

At its core, **P-Zero is a framework—not a fixed program.** Where a traditional program prescribes a set sequence of lifts, reps, and progressions over a defined timeline, a framework offers structure without rigidity. P-Zero provides foundational rules, tiers, and progression models, while giving lifters the freedom to customize based on their goals, recovery capacity, and rate of adaptation. You can run it as a full-body routine, an upper/lower split, a bodybuilding cycle, or a strength-focused peaking block. The framework adapts to you—not the other way around.

## Tier-Based Structure

P-Zero is organized into three tiers:

- **T1**: Heavy compound lifts for maximal strength
- **T2**: Moderate-load compounds for hypertrophy and strength-endurance
- **T3**: Lighter accessory work for volume, balance, and muscular development

Each tier progresses through predefined volume stages, and each lift advances independently based on performance—there’s no forced linear progression across the whole program. Additionally, stage progression for T1 and T2 lifts isn't a reward for achieving an arbitrary goal—it’s a response to performance decline, indicating that you've fully extracted the value of that volume range. This design ensures that stronger lifts can be milked for more volume, while weaker or more technical ones can cycle stages faster.

## Adaptive, Sustainable Progression

P-Zero is built on the principle that **sustainable progress comes from intelligent structure + real-time adaptation.** It prioritizes:

- Structured tiers and stages that promote an even balance of strength, hypertrophy, and conditioning
- High-quality, repeatable volume
- Built-in progressive overload and volume/intensity periodization
- Custom progression by lift, not by calendar
- Movement variety and autoregulated training stress

This makes it ideal for long-term development. Whether you're a beginner building work capacity or an advanced lifter fine-tuning intensity, P-Zero scales to your needs.

## More Than Just Strength or Size

What sets P-Zero apart is how it blends the best of multiple training philosophies: powerlifting-style intensity, bodybuilding-level volume, conditioning for work capacity, and built-in progression logic. Optional modules like **Ultra singles** and **rep maxes** provide additional structure for lifters who want to practice heavy attempts or prepare for performance goals.

The framework also integrates both **aerobic and anaerobic conditioning**, reinforcing recovery, stamina, and training density—elements often overlooked in traditional strength programs.

**P-Zero isn’t just a way to get stronger or bigger—it’s a system that teaches you how to train for life.** It gives you the tools to train hard without burning out, to progress without stalling, and to adapt without guesswork. Whether your goal is powerlifting, aesthetics, or general athleticism, P-Zero provides a reliable, scalable foundation to build on.

Learn the system. Apply it intelligently. Then make it your own.

## High-Level Instructions

1. Pick out your T1, T2, and T3 lifts and consider if you will be structuring your sessions around full-body or split programming
2. Determine if you will be including Ultra days, and at what cadence
3. Decide how you're going to incorporate conditioning/cardio, accounting for both aerobic and anaerobic
4. Establish your 1RM and TM for T1 and T2 lifts
5. Create your training program
   - P-Zero programs typically run on a cadence of 4 lifting sessions per week, but can easily be adapted to include more
   - Structure it as either open-ended or fixed-length, depending on preferences and goals
   - Break up lifting days with conditioning or rest days

## T1/T2 Warmup Sets

Warmup sets for heavy T1/T2 lifts are crucial in preventing injury, stress, and accumulated fatigue. Use the following warmup structure prior to beginning your T1/T2 working sets.

- 10 reps @ 30% working weight
- 5 reps @ 50% working weight
- 3 reps @ 70% working weight
- 1 rep @ 90% working weight (optional for T2)

_Note: If running P-Zero Ultra, then use your Ultra working weight rather than the normal T1 working weight._

## P-Zero Ultra – Summary & Integration Guide

**P-Zero Ultra** is an optional extension of the base P-Zero framework that front-loads your T1 lifts with **high-intensity singles** and/or **Rep Max (RM) sets**.

### Purpose of Ultra

- Practice lifting **very heavy loads** regularly (90–100%+ of TM)
- Improve **barbell skill, technical proficiency**, and **confidence** at high intensities
- Develop **maximal strength** and **neural efficiency**
- Introduce peaking-style exposure without committing to a full peaking block

### Why Use Ultra?

- You're plateauing with volume alone and need **intensity exposure**
- You plan to **test your 1RM** soon or compete in powerlifting
- You want to improve **rate of force development** and bar speed under near-maximal load
- You need to address **technical breakdowns** at heavy weights
- You’re already proficient at managing recovery and fatigue

### How to Modify Base P-Zero When Running Ultra

> Ultra work is **added before** your T1 volume.  
> Because of the added stress, **adjustments are usually necessary**.

#### Potential Modifications

- **Reduce T1 volume**:
  - Use 3x4, 3x3, 3x2 instead of 4 sets
  - Or skip AMRAP sets after singles or RM efforts
- **Reduce T2 intensity or volume**:
  - Use lighter weight or perform only 3 sets
  - Drop from 2 T2 exercises to 1 (if applicable)
- **Reduce T3 volume slightly**:
  - Cut ~10–15 total reps per exercise
  - Use fewer T3 exercises or lower rep stages
- **Use longer rest times** between T1 and T2 (and between T1 singles)

### Frequency Guidelines for Ultra

Ultra should be used **strategically**, not continuously.

#### Recommended Frequency:

- **Beginner to Early Intermediate**:
  - 1 Ultra session per week
  - Pick 1 T1 lift to focus on
  - Rotate every 1-3 weeks
- **Intermediate to Advanced**:
  - 2 Ultra sessions per week, max
  - Pick 2 different T1 lifts to focus on
  - Never run Ultra days back-to-back

### When to **avoid or deload Ultra**

- Bar speed deteriorates noticeably
- Singles become grinders or technique breaks down
- Sleep, appetite, or motivation declines
- You’re accumulating joint or connective tissue pain

## Aerobic Cardio

Aerobic cardio supports the P-Zero program by improving recovery, work capacity, and fatigue resistance—allowing lifters to handle more volume and recover faster between sets and sessions. A strong aerobic base enhances overall endurance and resilience, making training more sustainable over time. Effective sessions should be low-to-moderate intensity (60–80% max heart rate), last approximately 30 minutes, and use simple modalities like biking, rowing, or walking. Progress by increasing time, pace, or distance, and optionally include light core work for variety without compromising the aerobic focus.

- **Frequency**: ~2x per week
- **Duration**: ~30m per session
- **Progression**: Gradually increase time, distance, or heart rate zone over the course of several weeks. Build in a progression that is at least three weeks before resetting, changing exercises, or changing progression format.
- **Format**: Cross-train with different aerobic activities to reduce injury risk and maintain variety. Walking, running, biking, swimming, etc. Mix in light ab work when you can.
- **Zones**: The bulk of your aerobic training should be in Zone 2 or 3, but Zone 1 can be useful for light recovery and Zone 4 can add a bit of an anaerobic focus.
- **Tracking Progress**: Use tools like heart rate monitors to track pace, distance, and heart rate. Alternatively, or in addition, you can perform periodic fitness tests (e.g., a timed 5K or VO₂ max test) to measure improvement.
- **Timing Options**: On conditioning days separate from lifting, or after a shorter lifting session (especially upper-body days)

## Anaerobic Cardio

Anaerobic cardio complements the P-Zero program by developing explosive power, increasing lactic acid tolerance, and expanding high-intensity work capacity. It enhances your ability to sustain effort during taxing sets and recover faster between hard bursts of exertion—crucial for effective T1 and T2 lifting. This style of conditioning uses short, intense efforts and challenges both muscular and metabolic systems under fatigue. Two primary methods integrate anaerobic cardio into P-Zero:

### 1. Structured Supersets + CAT (Compensatory Acceleration Training)

Lifting sessions themselves can be a vehicle for anaerobic conditioning. Pairing exercises and minimizing rest creates high-density workouts that train both strength and anaerobic capacity. The key is to maintain bar speed and intent via **CAT**—exploding through the concentric phase of every rep, even at submaximal loads.

Create a **superset** by combining two lifts (e.g. squat + bench) and running the first set of each back-to-back with minimal rest in between. Rest for a normal amount of time after the combined first set and then repeat for the remaining sets.

- **Superset Formats**:
  - T1 & T2 (if opposing lifts: e.g., squat + press)
  - T1/T2 with T3s (e.g., press + lateral raise)
  - T3-only pairings for any remaining T3 movements
- **Rest Intervals**:
  - Minimal between exercises (~0–30s)
  - ~30s–3m between supersets depending on tier
- **Progression**: Reduce rest or improve bar speed

### 2. Dedicated C-A Sessions (Anaerobic Circuits)

Short, focused circuits of explosive bodyweight or weighted movements designed to be completed **AMRAP-style** (as many rounds as possible) in a fixed time window. These sessions train power output, conditioning, and movement efficiency under fatigue.

- **Frequency**: ~2x per week
- **Duration**: 5-9m
- **Format**: Choose 3–5 bodyweight or plyometric movements (e.g., jump squats, kettlebell swings, burpees, push-ups, sprints, med ball slams) and perform as many rounds as possible in a **fixed time**.
- **Progression**:
  - Week 1: 5m
  - Week 2: 7m
  - Week 3: 9m
  - Then reset with different exercises or added resistance
- **Timing Options**: On conditioning days separate from lifting, or after a shorter lifting session (especially upper-body days)

## The 1:2:3 Volume Distribution Rule

The **1:2:3 ratio** in P-Zero represents the relative volume assigned to each training tier: **T1 (strength), T2 (hypertrophy), and T3 (targeted muscle development)**. This ratio scales volume logically across the tiers to align with the purpose and recovery demands of each.

The 1:2:3 ratio is not rigid, but a **guiding principle**. It's effective because it acknowledges the trade-off between **intensity and recoverability**, giving each tier the workload it can best utilize for long-term progress.

- **T1 (1x T1 volume)** is the most intense, heaviest work. It uses high loads, low reps, and requires significant neural effort. Total volume is kept low to prevent fatigue accumulation and allow for technical focus.
- **T2 (2x T1 volume)** uses moderate intensity to build muscle and strength-endurance. Its manageable loads allow for higher volume, driving hypertrophy without overtaxing recovery.
- **T3 (3x T1 volume)** focuses on targeted muscle work and weak points. Light, often isolation-based exercises allow for high volume with minimal systemic fatigue.

## Training Max (TM)

The **Training Max (TM)** is a calculated percentage of your true maximum strength, used to guide loading for your lifts. It ensures manageable intensity, promotes consistent progress, and supports recovery by keeping daily training weights submaximal—especially important for speed-focused lifting (CAT) and high-volume work.

### How to Calculate TM

- **T1 (Heavy Compound)**:  
  TM = 90% of a recent, technically sound 1-rep max
- **T2 (Moderate Compounds)**:  
  TM = 90% of a recent 10-rep max  
  _or_  
  TM = 60–70% of your T1 1RM
- **T3 (Accessories)**:  
  No TM—choose a weight that challenges you for 10–20+ reps per set

## Independent Lift Progression

Each major lift (e.g., squat, bench, deadlift, press) progresses **on its own timeline**, based on:

- **Technical proficiency**
- **Capacity to complete prescribed reps**
- **Quality of AMRAP performance (T1)**
- **Rate of fatigue accumulation**

If your squat is stalling but your bench is progressing, there's no reason to deload both. **Only advance or reset each lift when the data demands it.**

**Key principle:** _"Don't force a lift forward just to stay in sync with others."_  
Strong lifts can stay in a stage longer; weaker or more technical lifts may cycle faster.

## Full Body vs. Split Programming

**Full-body programming** trains multiple major muscle groups in each session—typically pairing a lower-body T1 with an upper-body T2 (or vice versa), followed by a mix of T3s. This structure emphasizes frequent exposure to main lifts, better movement skill retention, and more balanced training across the week. It's well-suited to a 4 day training schedule and aligns naturally with P-Zero's 1:2:3 volume distribution. However, full-body sessions can be longer and require careful load management to avoid fatigue bleed from early to later exercises. Running full-body sessions on back-to-back days is discouraged.

**Split programming** isolates training to fewer muscle groups per session (e.g., Upper/Lower, Push/Pull, or body part splits). This allows for more concentrated volume and recovery per muscle group, making it ideal for 4–6 day schedules and physique-focused goals. It simplifies fatigue management but reduces frequency per lift or pattern unless volume is increased accordingly. Split programming is more tolerant of back-to-back lifting days.

## Deloading in P-Zero

Deloads in P-Zero are **not pre-scheduled** unless you are running a fixed-length program. In the base framework, **deloading is reactive and localized**:

### Deload Per Lift (Recommended)

This is the primary recommended deloading strategy in P-Zero. By adopting this strategy, you can train for longer stretches without requiring a full-program deload.

Deload **only the lift** that’s showing signs of:

- Performance regression across multiple workouts
- Inability to complete prescribed reps (not just AMRAP)
- Loss of bar speed despite adequate recovery
- Accumulating joint or tendon discomfort

**How to deload a lift**:

- Drop back to **Stage 1 volume** with a reduced working weight (~5–15% lower)
- Rebuild progression from there with better technique, control, and recovery

### Full-Program Deload (Situational)

Consider a **full-body deload week** when:

- Multiple lifts are stalling simultaneously
- General fatigue, sleep, or mood is declining
- Recovery markers (e.g., heart rate variability, soreness, energy) are poor
- You’ve completed several cycles without a break

**Full-program deload options:**

- Reduce load by 10–20%
- Cut volume by 30–50%
- Eliminate AMRAP sets
- Use variations or lighter movements (e.g., goblet squats, push-ups)

**Frequency:** As needed. Typically once every 6-12 weeks for most lifters (less often if conditioning is prioritized and recovery is well-managed)

## Tips for Managing an Open-Ended Program

**1. Track everything.**  
Log sets, reps, AMRAP results, rest times, and bar speed impressions. Objective data helps determine when to advance or deload.

**2. Evaluate performance trends, not emotions.**  
One bad day doesn’t mean you need a deload. Multiple subpar sessions in a row do.

**3. Adjust volume tiers independently.**  
If T1 progression is heavy and grinding, scale back T2/T3 volume. Conversely, if T1 is light, use that opportunity to push volume elsewhere.

**4. Rotate assistance lifts as needed.**  
Swap T2 and T3 movements every few weeks to prevent boredom, address weak points, and prevent overuse.

**5. Use microloading.**  
Progress can stall due to aggressive jumps. Use 1–2.5 lb increases on upper-body lifts to extend progress.

**6. Cycle pyramid shapes.**  
Vary the balance of T1:T2:T3 volume to match your current goals or fatigue levels:

- Steep pyramid → heavy strength bias
- Flat pyramid → hypertrophy/work capacity bias
- Balanced pyramid → general progression

**7. Respect fatigue bleed.**  
High fatigue in T1 impacts downstream work. When you push T1 (e.g., with Ultra), plan accordingly for reduced T2/T3 volume.

**8. Let momentum build.**  
Don’t rush stage advancement. Milk each stage for all it’s worth before progressing. This builds adaptation, not just numbers.

## Using P-Zero For Creating Fixed-Length Training Programs

While P-Zero was designed as an open-ended progression model, it also adapts well to **fixed-length programs**—structured training blocks with predefined durations (e.g., 3, 6, or 9 weeks). These models are useful when:

- You want predictable milestones and deadlines
- You're preparing for a specific event (vacation, testing day, meet)
- You perform better with strict structure and time-bound goals
- You want a deload or training reset built-in at the end of the cycle

P-Zero's tiered structure and volume stages make it easy to convert into linear, time-based progressions while preserving its balance of strength and hypertrophy.

### Stage Cycling Across a Timeline

Each training tier (T1, T2, T3) includes **three progression stages**. Fixed programs work by assigning **specific stages to specific weeks**—cycling the stages over the course of the program. This is in contrast to the base form of P-Zero, which is open-ended and progresses through stages per-lift according to training criteria rather than time.

**Example 1**: In a 6-week plan, each stage might last 2 weeks.

| Weeks | T1/T2/T3 Stage |
| ----- | -------------- |
| 1-2   | T1             |
| 3-4   | T2             |
| 5-6   | T3             |

**Example 2**: You could also structure your stages in a staggered manner across each tier so that you are always in a somewhat balanced state of volume and intensity.

| Weeks | T1 Stage | T2 Stage | T3 Stage |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1-2   | 1        | 2        | 3        |
| 3-4   | 2        | 3        | 1        |
| 5-6   | 3        | 1        | 2        |

### Common Fixed-Length Structures

#### **3-Week Program**

- Weekly stage changes
- Rapid load increases (e.g., +5% per week)
- Ideal for short intensification blocks or “tester” cycles

#### **6-Week Program**

- 2 weeks per stage
- Moderate weekly progression
- Great for hypertrophy and strength blends

#### **9-Week Program**

- 3 weeks per stage
- Slower, sustainable build-up
- Good for managing recovery and gradual load increases

**Tip**: Multiple 3-week cycles can be stacked together to create a periodized training plan by emphasizing different muscle groups in each block—such as Shoulders, Legs, Arms, and Back (SLAB)—allowing you to rotate focus, manage fatigue, and drive continuous progress across the full physique over time. This same concept could also be applied to an open-ended training plan.

### Building Your Own Fixed-Length P-Zero Program

**1. Choose a duration:**  
Common blocks are 6, 9, or 12 weeks. This determines how long you'll stay in each stage.

**2. Assign stage durations:**  
Divide your total weeks into 3 (or 6 if repeating stages). For example:

- 6-week plan → 2 weeks per stage
- 9-week plan → 3 weeks per stage

**3. Set weekly progression goals:**  
Typical increases:

- T1: +2.5–5% per stage
- T2: +2.5–5% per stage
- T3: +2.5–5 lbs or improved density (reps/sets)

**4. Determine if Ultra will be included:**  
If yes, determine how you're going to account for managing stress and fatigue.

**5. Include autoregulation rules:**  
Even with a fixed timeline, stay flexible:

- If performance drops, reduce volume or repeat a week
- If you miss reps, drop to the previous week’s load

**6. Account for cardio:**  
Both aerobic and anaerobic conditioning are core to P-Zero. They improve recovery, build work capacity, and support long-term progress. Program them intentionally.

## Summary of John's Modifications, Improvements, Simplifications, or Clarifications to the Original P-Zero

- No last set AMRAP allowed for Ultra singles
  Reasoning: Ultra is already an optional modification. Adding another optional on top of an optional creates unnecessary complexity. Also, if you want to do AMRAP, you should probably just be doing the rep max variant of Ultra.
- Added more clear direction for what to choose as the T3 starting weight
  Reasoning: The original P-Zero wasn't super clear on this
- Implemented T3 stage progression logic by staying true to the spirit of P-Zero and the purpose of the T3 tier
  Reasoning: This was an oversight in the original P-Zero program
- Locked Ultra so that it advances in tandem with T1, rather than following it's own progression logic
  Reasoning: The Ultra module is intended to be an extension of or modification to the T1 tier, rather than being a totally new tier. For this reason, it should stay in sync with T1.
- Made Ultra weight a function of the current T1 weight, rather than tying it to 1RM/TM
  Reasoning: 1RM/TM could easily go up over the course of several weeks, but you likely aren't testing your 1RM/TM this frequently. This could have created weird divergences between the Ultra sets and the working sets.
- Dropped the A1, B1, A2, B2 naming convention for lift days
  Reasoning: There's no logical or thematic connection between the lift days in P-Zero (unless you modify the program to make it so). The A1, B1 naming convention implied that there was, which was confusing.
- Dropped any mention of myo-reps
  Reasoning: Since you're supposed to be pushing your T3 sets close to technical failure anyway, the concept of myo-reps is kinda already baked in.
- Simplified the T1/T2 warmup structure by reducing the lead-in sets to 3-4, down from a potential 7-8
  Reasoning: The beauty of P-Zero is that it's fairly simple with just the right amount of structure and logic. Unless you are a very advanced lifter moving huge weight, beginning lifts with 7-8 warm-up sets is likely overkill and adds monotony and time.
